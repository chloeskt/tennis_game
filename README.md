# Tennis Game

This is a repository based on a JS Tutorial to create a simple tennis game in JavaScript. It is my first project in JS. 

## Installation

To install the game, run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chloeskt/tennis_game.git
```

## Run the game

Once the repo is cloned, run in your brower the `dist/index.html` file. You can use your mouse to control the left paddle. Enjoy !
